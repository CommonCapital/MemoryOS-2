# MemoryOS-2 🧠🕸️

MemoryOS is a powerful personal knowledge base that combines traditional **RAG (Vector Search)** with a **High-Fidelity Knowledge Graph**. It doesn't just store your notes; it understands the structural, causal, and semantic relationships between your ideas.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Hybrid Retrieval Engine
Every query runs two parallel pipelines to ensure nothing is missed:
- **Path A (Vector):** Semantic similarity search against note chunks using `pgvector`.
- **Path B (Graph):** Semantic entry-point matching followed by a structural BFS traversal (Recursive CTE) through typed relations.
- **Fusion:** Results are merged, deduplicated, and boosted if verified by both systems.

### 2. High-Fidelity Knowledge Graph
Nodes are not just buckets for notes; they are first-class entities (People, Concepts, Tech, etc.) with:
- **Typed Relations:** `is_a`, `causes`, `works_at`, `part_of`, and more.
- **Directional Links:** Solid arrows for 1-way relationships, double arrows for bidirectional.
- **Confidence Scores:** Visual translucency for AI-extracted relations with lower confidence.

### 3. Interactive Memory Visualization
- **Graph Explorer:** A React Flow-based canvas with automatic degree-based sizing and relation-aware styling.
- **Vector Cluster Map:** A 2D UMAP projection of your entire note library, allowing you to see semantic "islands" of thought.
- **Retrieval Inspector:** An X-ray view of the last AI query, showing the exact path the graph traversal took.

### 4. Memory Health Dashboard
Monitor your memory in real-time. Trigger batch re-indexing or re-extraction of entities across your entire database with a single click.

---

## 🚦 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- Python 3.10+
- PostgreSQL with `pgvector` installed

### 2. Environment Setup
Create a `.env.local` (frontend) and `.env` (ai-service) file:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/memoryos"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_key"
AI_PROVIDER="anthropic" # or "openai"
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npx prisma db push

# AI Service
cd ../ai-service
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
# Terminal 1: AI Service
cd ai-service
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## 🕸️ Graph Taxonomy
MemoryOS uses a canonical taxonomy for extracted relations to ensure consistency:
- **Structural:** `is_a`, `part_of`, `type_of`
- **Causal:** `causes`, `enables`, `requires`
- **Social:** `works_at`, `knows`, `founded`
- **Temporal:** `precedes`, `succeeded_by`
- **Hierarchy:** `broader_than`, `narrower_than`

---

## 🤖 AI Integration (MCP)
MemoryOS supports the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, allowing you to connect AI assistants (like Antigravity or Claude Code) directly to your knowledge base.

### Connecting an Assistant
1. **Build the MCP Server:**
   ```bash
   cd mcp-server
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
2. **Configure your AI Client:**
   Add the following to your AI client's MCP configuration (e.g., `mcp-config.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "memoryos": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/absolute/path/to/mcp-server/dist/index.js"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. **Available Tools:**
   Once connected, the AI can use tools like `search_notes`, `graph_query`, and `ask_memory` to interact with your data.
